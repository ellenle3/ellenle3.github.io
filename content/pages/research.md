Currently, I work with Mike Connelley as an RA for the NASA Infrared Telescope
Facility (IRTF) to support the facilitization of a new type of adaptive secondary
mirror (ASM). I also split my time as an RA for Mark Chun to investigate the long-term
behavior of the ASM and investigate methods of controlling mechanical resonances
on large deformable mirrors. Finally, I perform observations of protoplanetary
disks with SCExAO to study star and planet formation from its earliest stages.

## A new type of adaptive secondary mirror for IRTF

My current position is as an RA for IRTF to support the adaptive secondary
mirror and low-order wavefront sensor FELIX, which will allow us to investigate
gains to the performance of our science instruments with active optics correction.
As part of my dissertation, I will investigate the long-term behavior of these
actuators in a telescope environment and control of mechanical resonances

I am also working to facilitize IRTF's adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) with the off-axis facility guider FELIX.

### Misc. IRTF instrumentation
I'm an RA for IRTF
- ['Opihi:](http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~opihi/)
- [Spectre:](http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~spectre/)

I also use IRTF's near-IR spectrographs iSHELL (R\~55,000) and SpeX (R\~2,500)
to support my disk imaging campaign with SCExAO on Subaru.
