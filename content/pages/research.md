## IRTF-ASM-1
This includes basic verification...
- my SPIE paper
- Suz's close loop paper
I am also working to facilitize IRTF's adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) with the off-axis facility guider FELIX.

## Disk imaging
SCExAO NIR WFS


## Other Projects
### High-resolution spectroscopy of FU Orionis objects
iSHELL

### Misc. IRTF instrumentation
I'm an RA for IRTF
- ['Opihi:](http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~opihi/)
- [Spectre:](http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~spectre/)

I also use IRTF's near-IR spectrographs iSHELL (R\~55,000) and SpeX (R\~2,500)
to support my disk imaging campaign with SCExAO on Subaru. I've touched
almost every instrument on IRTF at this point... Just need an excuse to
observe in the mid-infrared with MIRSI..
