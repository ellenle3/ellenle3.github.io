Communicating science to the public is especially important in Hawai'i,
where we have the enormous privilege of observing from Maunakea. Here
are the main activities that I'm involved with:
- Maunakea scholars
- JTTU
- Astroday
- SciOly
Other than that, I regularly participate in outreach events around the
Big Island.
