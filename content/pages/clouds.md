# the atmosphere

[Check out the Maunakea Weather Center.](http://mkwc.ifa.hawaii.edu/) They have
webcams of the summit and interesting meterological information in their forecasts.

## lenticular clouds
Have you ever been in 70 mph winds at 14,000 ft above sea level? (Please say "no.")
It's pretty dangerous, especially if there's ice on the road.

## nice inversion layer
When the clouds are low and flat like this, it means that seeing is probably going
to be good.

The image below certainly looks more interesting, but it's likely that there
is more atmospheric turbulence.
