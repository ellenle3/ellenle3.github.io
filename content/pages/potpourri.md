## ancient history
As an undergraduate[^1], I worked on submm/far-IR
instrumentation with Gordon Stacey. Most of my work was optomechanical
design, although I ended up touching a lot of different projects during
my 3 years in that lab. Here are a few highlights:

- EoR-Spec:
- ZEUS-2:
- HIRMES: Rest in peace.

I also had a brief stint working at NASA GSFC. The summer before I advanced
to candidacy, I worked with Terra Hardwick in the Mars Sample Return (MSR)
Capture, Containment and Return System (CCRS) Vision System (VS) lab
(phew... NASA sure loves complicated acronyms). I created a software
package that automatically preprocesses image data generated with FRED
and trains a convolutional neural network to perform orientation checks
of the orbiting Mars samples.

I feel very fortunate to have worked with wonderful people at the earliest
stages of my academic career. Thanks for everything, everyone! <3 




[^1]: I technically started even earlier than this.
When I was in high school, I volunteered UCSD for a few weeks to fabricate
lenslet arrays for POLARBEAR-2. I didn't know anything about instrumenation
at the time, let alone that I would end up going into this field (albeit
at shorter wavelengths). Those were the days...
