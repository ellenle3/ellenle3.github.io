## background
I (pronouns: she/her) grew up in [San Diego County](/other/bonita.jpg) with my
[wonderful](/other/mom.jpg) [parents](/other/dad.jpg) and my sibling [Mael](/other/mael.jpg),
who are the most important people to me in the world. I flew six hours to the east
and attended Cornell University to earn a B.S. in [Engineering Physics](/other/aep.jpg).
Upon graduating, I went six hours to the west for my Ph.D. and ended up in
[the middle of the Pacific](/other/suz.jpg) at IfA Hilo.

## ancient history
As an undergraduate[^1], I worked on submm/far-IR instrumentation with Gordon
Stacey. I ended up touching many different projects during the 3 years I had there.
Notably, I worked on optomechanical designs for EoR-Spec, HIRMES, and ZEUS-2.

I also had a brief stint working at NASA GSFC. The summer before I advanced
to candidacy, I worked with Terra Hardwick in the Mars Sample Return (MSR)
Capture, Containment and Return System (CCRS) Vision System (VS) lab
(phew... NASA sure loves complicated acronyms). I created a software
package that automatically preprocesses image data generated with FRED
and trains a convolutional neural network to perform orientation checks
of the orbiting Mars samples.

I feel very fortunate to have worked with kind people at the earliest stages of
my academic career. Thanks for everything, everyone! <3 


[^1]: I technically started even earlier than this.
When I was in high school, I volunteered UCSD for a few weeks to fabricate
lenslet arrays for POLARBEAR-2. I didn't know anything about instrumenation
at the time, let alone that I would end up in this field albeit
at shorter wavelengths!
