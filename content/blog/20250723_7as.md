We just came out of an observing run with the IRTF ASM. The weather... wasn't great...
but we were able to obtain useful data. One night Subaru reported **7"** seeing.

Our 12x12 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor looked like wind blowing through a
field of wheat.

For reference, the subapertures are 4.5" across and the spots usually look like
this:

I would share focal plane data but on-target images look more like flat fields.
Some conditions are so miserable that they wrap around to being spectacular!
