  <p>We just came out of an observing run with the IRTF ASM. The weather&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t great&hellip;
but we were able to obtain useful data. One night Subaru reported <strong>7&quot;</strong> seeing.</p>
<p>Our 12x12 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor looked like wind blowing through a
field of wheat.

<p>For reference, the subapertures are 4.5&quot; across and the spots usually look like
this:
<img alt="12x12 grid with an image of the star in each subaperture, each of which looks like nice, small point" src="/blog/20250723/12x12spots.png"></p>
<p>I would share focal plane data but on-target images look more like flat fields.
Some conditions are so miserable that they wrap around to being spectacular!</p>
