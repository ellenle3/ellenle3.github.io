  <p>Currently, I work with Mike Connelley as an RA for the NASA Infrared Telescope
Facility (IRTF) to support the facilitization of a new type of adaptive secondary
mirror (ASM). I also split my time as an RA for Mark Chun to investigate the long-term
behavior of the ASM and investigate methods of controlling mechanical resonances
on large deformable mirrors. Finally, I perform observations of protoplanetary
disks with SCExAO to study star and planet formation from its earliest stages.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-type-of-adaptive-secondary-mirror-for-irtf">A new type of adaptive secondary mirror for IRTF</h2>
<p>My current position is as an RA for IRTF to support the adaptive secondary
mirror and low-order wavefront sensor FELIX, which will allow us to investigate
gains to the performance of our science instruments with active optics correction.
As part of my dissertation, I will investigate the long-term behavior of these
actuators in a telescope environment and control of mechanical resonances</p>
