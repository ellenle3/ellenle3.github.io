<p>As an undergraduate<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I worked on submm/far-IR
instrumentation with Gordon Stacey. Most of my work was optomechanical
design, although I ended up touching a lot of different projects during
my 3 years in that lab. Here are a few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>EoR-Spec:</li>
<li>ZEUS-2:</li>
<li>HIRMES: Rest in peace.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also had a brief stint working at NASA GSFC. The summer before I advanced
to candidacy, I worked with Terra Hardwick in the Mars Sample Return (MSR)
Capture, Containment and Return System (CCRS) Vision System (VS) lab
(phew&hellip; NASA sure loves complicated acronyms). I created a software
package that automatically preprocesses image data generated with FRED
and trains a convolutional neural network to perform orientation checks
of the orbiting Mars samples.</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate to have worked with wonderful people at the earliest
stages of my academic career. Thanks for everything, everyone! &lt;3</p>

<p>I technically started even earlier than this.
When I was in high school, I volunteered UCSD for a few weeks to fabricate
lenslet arrays for POLARBEAR-2. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about instrumenation
at the time, let alone that I would end up going into this field (albeit
at shorter wavelengths). Those were the days&hellip;&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
