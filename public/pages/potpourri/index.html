<p>I (pronouns: she/her) grew up in <a href="/other/bonita.jpg">San Diego County</a> with my
<a href="/other/mom.jpg">wonderful</a> <a href="/other/dad.jpg">parents</a> and my sibling <a href="/other/mael.jpg">Mael</a>,
who are the most important people to me in the world. I flew six hours to the east
and attended Cornell University to earn a B.S. in <a href="/other/aep.jpg">Engineering Physics</a>.
Upon graduating, I went six hours to the west for my Ph.D. and ended up in
<a href="/other/suz.jpg">the middle of the Pacific</a> at IfA Hilo.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I worked on submm/far-IR instrumentation with Gordon
Stacey. I ended up touching many different projects during the 3 years I had there.
Notably, I worked on optomechanical designs for EoR-Spec, HIRMES, and ZEUS-2.</p>
<p>I also had a brief stint working at NASA GSFC. The summer before I advanced
to candidacy, I worked with Terra Hardwick in the Mars Sample Return (MSR)
Capture, Containment and Return System (CCRS) Vision System (VS) lab
(phew&hellip; NASA sure loves complicated acronyms). I created a software
package that automatically preprocesses image data generated with FRED
and trains a convolutional neural network to perform orientation checks
of the orbiting Mars samples.</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate to have worked with kind people at the earliest stages of
my academic career. Thanks for everything, everyone! &lt;3</p>

<p>I technically started even earlier than this.
When I was in high school, I volunteered UCSD for a few weeks to fabricate
lenslet arrays for POLARBEAR-2. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about instrumenation
at the time, let alone that I would end up in this field albeit
at shorter wavelengths!&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
