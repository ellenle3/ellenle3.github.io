## Activities

Communicating science to the public is especially important in Hawai'i, where we
have the enormous privilege of observing from Maunakea. Here are the main activities
that I'm involved with:

- Maunakea scholars
- JTTU
- Astroday
- Science Olympiad at the University of Hawai'i: I was also involved in Science
Olympiad as an undergraduate.

Other than that, I regularly participate in outreach events around the Big Island.

## Mentoring

I've mentored a few students as well!
